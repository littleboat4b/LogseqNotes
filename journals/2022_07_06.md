- **Xournal++ supports LaTeX input**
  id:: 66291cb1-183e-4885-9c80-47f7d0b3233f
	- but I can't get it to work. Xournal++ documentation (linked below) says that texlive-latex-extra or texlive-standalone must be installed, but as far as I can tell, these are not available in the Solus repo. I do have texlive installed ,and I just tried installing texlive-all in the naive hope that something in there would solve the problem, but it did not work. Any help appreciated.
	- ==SOLUTION==: I found a similar question on the Xournal++ github, linked below. Installing texlive should be sufficient. One needs to `change default_template.tex to legacy_template.tex` in the global template file path under `Edit > Preferences > LaTeX`.
